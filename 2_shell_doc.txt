Notes:
    malloc, realloc as needed MR
    xallocd memory persists till end of program
    so simply return the address of xallocd space

Read:
    input and parse line
    split into words; tokenize
    strtok

Evaluate:
    call fork
    call execvp in child
    handle built in cmds seperately with funcptrs

    execvp:
        accepts filename, and array of argstrs
        argstrs 
        -> first arg is filename
        -> last arg must be null
        returns -1 iff error

Print:
    outputs / error messages

Loop if status
